### Deploy an Azure Databricks workspace

1. Click the following button to open the ARM template in the Azure Portal.

   [![Deploy To Azure](https://aka.ms/deploytoazurebutton)](https://portal.azure.com/#create/Microsoft.Template/uri/https%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2FAzure%2Fazure-quickstart-templates%2Fmaster%2Fquickstarts%2Fmicrosoft.databricks%2Fdatabricks-workspace%2Fazuredeploy.json)

1. Provide the required values to create your Azure Databricks workspace:

   - **Subscription**: Choose the Azure Subscription in which to deploy the workspace.
   - **Resource Group**: Leave at Create new and provide a name for the new resource group. **Note**: If you are using a hosted lab environment, you may not be allowed to create a new resource group. In this case, select the existing resource group provided to you.
   - **Region**: Select a location near you for deployment. For the list of regions supported by Azure Databricks, see [Azure services available by region](https://azure.microsoft.com/regions/services/).
   - **Workspace Name**: Enter a unique name for your workspace.
   - **Enable No Public Ip**: Set to `false`.
   - **Pricing Tier**: Ensure `premium` is selected.
   - **Location**: Leave this at the default `[resourceGroup()location]` value.
